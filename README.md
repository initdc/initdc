I build the `KodBox` repo in the wrong way.

it should not use `cp` only, it should `rm` all content  before `cp`, to avoid the git **can not** track deleted files in incoming commits

New repo has build, here is the link: https://github.com/pliplive/kodbox

Check  out the official open source repo by the official **KodCloud team**, **https://github.com/kalcaddle/kodbox**
